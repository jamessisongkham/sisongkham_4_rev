Make code art as we did with Processing, i.e., trim the picture and pick out the code you hink is most important to the generation of your picture.
Ensure that your files are labeled appropriately, e.g.,
lastname_period_methodsmadness.java #for the Java file
lastname_period_methodsmadness_essay #for the essay
lastname_period_methodsmadness_codeart.png #for the PNG of your code art
BE SURE TO EXPORT your picture as a PNG!
Make sure that these have all been pushed to github, i.e., go to github and locate the files
send an email with the subject line #methodsmadness_period to ddavis2@neisd.net and include the actual url for each file [NOT JUST A LINK TO THE REPOSITORY]
